## [What is Bidirectional SFP](https://www.versitron.com/products/fe10sm-small-formfactor-pluggable-transceivers-lifetime-warranty-10)  
A **bidirectional SFP**, or **BiDi SFP**, is a fiber optic transceiver that enables both transmission and reception over a **single strand of fiber**. This is achieved by using **two different wavelengths**—typically 1310 nm for transmit and 1550 nm for receive (or vice versa). BiDi SFPs are commonly used to reduce fiber cabling requirements in point-to-point or space-limited deployments.

## [How BiDi SFP Works](https://www.versitron.com/products/gb10sm-small-formfactor-pluggable-transceivers-lifetime-warranty-3)  
**How BiDi SFP works** is based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology. Each BiDi SFP uses one wavelength for transmitting and another for receiving. A pair of BiDi SFPs—each with opposite TX and RX wavelengths—are installed at either end of a single fiber link. This setup allows full-duplex communication with half the fiber, reducing cabling infrastructure and installation costs while maintaining gigabit-level speeds.
